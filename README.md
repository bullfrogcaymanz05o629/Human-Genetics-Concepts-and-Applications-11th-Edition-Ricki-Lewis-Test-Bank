Today human genetics is for everyone. It is about variation more than about illnesses and increasingly about the common rather than about the rare. Once an obscure science or an occasional explanation for an odd collection of symptoms human genetics is now part of everyday conversation. By coming to know genetic backgrounds people can control their environments in more healthy ways. Genetic knowledge is therefore both informative and empowering. The 10th edition of Human Genetics: Concepts and Applications shows students how and why that is true.
